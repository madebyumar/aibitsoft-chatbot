 Churn rate How many leave (1 âˆ’ retention) Session duration & frequency How long and how often users engage Conversion events What actions users take (onboarding completion, purchases, feature use) Cohort analysis Group users by time or campaign to see behavior patterns LTV (lifetime value) How much revenue or value a user generates Funnel drop-off points Where in the flow users exit or get stuck These metrics tell your story where the app succeeds, where it fails, and where to prioritize fixes. ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Implementing even just a few of these can move your retention curve upward. Strategies That Work Engagement & Retention Why Users Leave Seamlessness & Stickiness Metrics to Watch How AiBit Soft Aligns Final Thought Strategies That Work: From Onboarding to Habit Here are proven strategies (with modern best practices) to keep users engaged beyond installs: Stage â†’ Strategy â†’ Why It Works Implementing even a few of these can move your retention curve upward.
