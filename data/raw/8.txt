CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT
The Cost of Poor Mobile Apps

Great mobile experiences drive growth—good UX can boost e-commerce app conversions by up to 400%.

$2.6

Slow-loading content leads to US$2.6 billion annual revenue loss due to user drop-offs.

Slow Load Times / Performance Issues

Slow, Confusing, Unattractive UI

Users leave before completing actions (purchase, signup etc.), leading to lost sales and higher abandonment rates.

25%

of users stop using an app after just 1 day; and 72% stop using by 30 days

Low User Retention

Users abandon app soon

High customer acquisition cost wasted; low lifetime value; fewer repeat purchases or interactions.

52%

of users drop off within first day because apps fail to streamline onboarding

Poor Mobile UX

Poor UX / confusing interface, bad onboarding

If new users drop off early, business loses potential recurring users, leads, and potential revenue.

7x

Mobile apps drive seven times the revenue per user and contribute 40–50% of total online sales for e-commerce brands.

Low Conversion

Low conversion vs browser or competitor apps

Businesses that rely only on websites or poor apps miss out on this higher revenue potential.
