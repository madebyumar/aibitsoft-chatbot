A CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT
The Cost Of Poor Social Media Advertising

Poorly managed ads drain budgets, miss opportunities, and let competitors capture your audience.

$276.7B

Social media ad spend is projected to reach US$276.7 billion in 2025

Low Awareness

Low awareness of brand/product among target audience

If people don't know your brand exists, they won't buy. Missed sales opportunities because you aren't showing up where your customers spend time.

2.50% / 1.51% CTR

Facebook ads average 2.50% click-through for lead generation and 1.51% for traffic; poor targeting means wasted spend.

Poor Targeting

Poor targeting or irrelevant ads

Ads that aren't targeted well waste budget. Poor ROI. Could attract wrong people who don't convert, lowering efficiency.

58%

of consumers discover new businesses via social media — skipping ads means losing these opportunities.

Missed Opportunities

Not using paid ads when many discover new businesses via social media

Missing out on being discovered by potential customers. That means fewer leads, less sales, slower growth.

76%

of consumers who had a good social media brand experience recommend it — poor ads damage trust and referrals.

Poor Ad Quality

Poor ad quality/design or message

If ads are lousy (boring, unclear, irrelevant), people won't trust or engage. That reduces click-throughs, leads, and word-of-mouth.
